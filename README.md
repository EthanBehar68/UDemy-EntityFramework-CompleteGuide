# UDemyEntityFrameworkCompleteGuide

The work I did when going through Mosh Hamedani's Entity Framework in Depth: The Complete Guide Course.

Before this course I haven't really worked with databases and SQL at all. The projects I worked on at my previous company never needed a database so I never implemented one.

So now I have an in depth understanding of Entity Framework, working with SQL Databases, and best practices.
